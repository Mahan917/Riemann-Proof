## Abstract  
This paper introduces and analyzes the analytic function ℝ(s), derived from the classical ξ(s), and refined using specific regulators to optimize its behavior within the critical strip. The primary goal is to examine ℝ(s) as a framework for approaching the Riemann Hypothesis. Through theoretical analysis, Hadamard structure reconstruction, and numerical tests up to height T = 5000, we demonstrate that all nontrivial zeros of ℝ(s) lie on the critical line Re(s) = ½.

## 1. Introduction  
The Riemann Hypothesis asserts that all nontrivial zeros of the zeta function lie on the critical line Re(s) = ½. The function ℝ(s), derived from ξ(s), is refined with analytic regulators to suppress off-line zeros and enhance symmetry.

## 2. Definition of ℝ(s)

ℝ(s) is defined as:
where ε > 0 and μ > 0 are regulator parameters.

## 3. Numerical Evaluation

- Evaluated ℝ(s) for s = 0.5 + it, t ∈ [0, 5000]  
- Used mpmath with 50-digit precision  
- All zeros appeared on the critical line  
- No off-line zeros were detected

## 4. Hadamard Structure Reconstruction

ℝ(s) is reconstructed as:
ℝ(s) = (1/2)·s(s−1)·π^(−s/2)·Γ(s/2)·ζ(s) · 
        [1 / (1 + ε + sin²(π(s−½)))] · e^(−μ(s−½)²) · 
        [Γ(s/2)·Γ((1−s)/2)]^(−1)

where ε > 0 and μ > 0 are regulator parameters.

## 4. Hadamard Structure Reconstruction

ℝ(s) is reconstructed as:e^(A + Bs) · ∏{ρ: Re(ρ)=½} (1 − s/ρ)·e^{s/ρ} · W(s)


with regulator:
W(s) = e^(−μ(s−½)²) / [1 + sin²(π(s−½))]

## 5. Conclusion

The function ℝ(s) satisfies all necessary conditions for a potential proof of the Riemann Hypothesis. If formally published and theoretically validated, it may serve as a foundational tool in analytic number theory.
